For about past 8 hours I have been trying to make a single jupyter notebook which can run on a loop and scrape the data for all the category of news on google news. But I have failed slight.
The single jupyter notebook file which I have made so far has not generated proper result. 
Problems:-
1. It does not always generate the right result
2. It generated copied result. If Business news runs first, then all the other news will be business news as well, as if that was the ony website that was scraped.
